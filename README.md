# Welcome to Personal Expenses Tracker


## How do I build this ?

Checkout the video -> [YTVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocWc_FFc5jE)

## Getting Started

### Local Development

I have already prepared a supabase project based on my YT course, and Github OAuth app, which would enable you to login and build features. The details are in `.env.stage`.

You can copy the `.env.stage` into your `.env` file, and run the remix-app at `localhost:3000` to use all the features.

If you do the above step right, then your app should be running locally.

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap

Features I would like to add:
- Adding dark-mode using Kent's latest client-hints library âœ…
- Adding notifications for "new posts" and when clicked users need to be scrolled to top
- Adding support for uploading images, preferably using S3
